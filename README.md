## Key Improvements

### Performance Enhancements
- **âš¡ Faster Startup**: Models load in seconds instead of minutes
- **ðŸ“Š Instant Analytics**: All insights available immediately from saved models
- **ðŸ”„ Smart Training**: Avoid unnecessary retraining
- **ðŸ’¾ Persistent Results**: Full model functionality retained across sessions

### User Experience
- **ðŸŽ¯ Clear Status**: Know exactly what models are available
- **ðŸš€ One-Click Insights**: Generate analysis without waiting
- **ðŸ“ˆ Immediate Visualization**: ROC curves, feature importance instantly available
- **ðŸ’° Direct Cost Analysis**: Treatment cost estimates from existing models

## Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- Streamlit (Web interface)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data processing)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

### Optional Libraries
- XGBoost (Enhanced gradient boosting)
- TensorFlow (Deep learning)

*Note: The application will run with core libraries even if optional libraries are not installed.*

## Usage

### Enhanced Workflow (New!)

1. **First Time Setup**:
   - Upload data files to the `data/` directory
   - Use the sidebar to configure data loading
   - Train models for the first time

2. **Subsequent Usage**:
   - **Automatic Loading**: Existing models are loaded automatically
   - **Instant Results**: Performance metrics available immediately
   - **Direct Analysis**: Generate insights and cost analysis without waiting
   - **Optional Retraining**: Use "Retrain" only when updating models

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Load Data**: Use the interface to load your healthcare datasets
2. **Check Model Status**: System automatically detects existing trained models
3. **View Results**: Analyze model performance and predictions instantly
4. **Generate Insights**: Get risk factors and treatment recommendations
5. **Cost Analysis**: Review potential savings from interventions
6. **Export Reports**: Download insights and visualizations

### Model Management

- **Auto-Discovery**: System finds existing models in `saved_models/` directory
- **Performance Calculation**: Metrics generated from saved models without retraining
- **Smart Training**: Only train when models don't exist or you want updates
- **Full Functionality**: All features work with loaded models (ROC curves, feature importance, etc.)

## Environment Variables

- `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT`: Port for Streamlit server (default: 8501)
- `STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS`: Server address (default: 0.0.0.0)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in docker-compose.yml or use a different port
2. **Memory issues**: Reduce dataset size or increase Docker memory allocation
3. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed
4. **Models not loading**: Check `saved_models/` directory permissions and file integrity

### Model Loading Issues

- **No existing models found**: This is normal on first run - train models once
- **Performance metrics missing**: Models will auto-load and calculate metrics
- **Slow loading**: Large models may take a few seconds to load initially
- **Feature importance errors**: Ensure tree-based models (Random Forest, etc.) are available

### Docker Issues

- Ensure Docker is running
- Check if ports are available
- Verify data volume mounts are correct
- Confirm `saved_models/` directory is properly mounted

## Technical Details

### Model Loading Process
1. **Auto-Discovery**: System scans `saved_models/` for existing model files
2. **Smart Loading**: Loads models and generates performance metrics without retraining
3. **Full Integration**: All features (insights, cost analysis, visualizations) work with loaded models
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Only retrain when actually needed
